## Dataset

Unzip the CarlaSC Finer Dataset you downloaded into this folder. After you run the script we provided `run_carla_process.sh` , three new datasets will be created. They are:

- `CarlaSC_quantized_32_32_4`
- `CarlaSC_quantized_64_64_8`
- `CarlaSC_quantized_256_256_16`

You need to ensure that your device has **at least 500GB** of storage space available to process and store the dataset.
